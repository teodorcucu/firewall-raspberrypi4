### RaspberryPI 4 as Firewall

---------


**RaspberryPI 4 Model B as Firewall (Smoothwall Express 3.1)**


**FAQ:**

    Q: Why I choose Smoothwall Express 3.1

	A: I was looking to get Ipfire on my new Raspberry Pi but at the moment (30.12.2020) is Ipfire not supporting the RaspberryPi 4. The only Firewall that's running well on RaspberryPi is Smoothwall Express 3.1 . And yes its quite better that I was thinking! It has a lot of features and community driven mods. And for RaspberryPi are not so much Firewall DISTROS and especially for the Raspberry 4, Smoothwall Express 3.1 was the only one that I found. And the last update for SWE 3.1 was at Jul 14, 2020. 
	----------------------------------------------------------
	Q: It's only working on RaspberryPi 4?

	A: I don't test it, but I think yes. If someone try it on a RaspberryPi 3 Model B+, just send me a message on Twitter.
	----------------------------------------------------------
	Q: What should I learn?
	
	A: Definitly iptables. 
	https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Communication_Networks/IP_Tables
	----------------------------------------------------------
	Q: I can't use DHCP simultantly on PURPLE(Wi-Fi) and Green(Switch)
	
	A: It only works if PURPLE is in other subnet as GREEN.
	
	----------------------------------------------------------
	Q: Do I need all of your Equipment?
	
	A: If you have something like the Products that I named it shouldn't be a problem but what i definitely recommend you to buy is the "Aluminium heat sink with fan", because the Raspi will get hot.
	If you don't have it, then buy all of these things because you will need it all (except the DSL Router/Modem, i mean you should have one lol).
	----------------------------------------------------------
	Q: I can't access from PURPLE stuffs on GREEN like Webservices etc, what can i do?
	
	A: You need to allow tcp/udp on every port from PURPLE to GREEN and from GREEN to PURPLE. You can do this only for one device or for all devices. You can do this on cli with iptables or on the Webinterface under Networking-Internal.
	----------------------------------------------------------

	Q: I want to build my own iptables chains/rules and delete the one that get coocked up at booting...
	
	A: You can write a script and add it at the last line of /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit or you can write/delete the standard one in /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall.up
	
	Your bestfriend is /etc/rc.d !!!!
	----------------------------------------------------------

	Q: I can't access the firewall from PURPLE, even https or ssh
	
	A: You need to allow it. You can allow it from the webinterface under services->remote access
	----------------------------------------------------------

	Q: It's PPPOE working?
	
	A: Yes, im using it as PPPOE with a FritzBox (Yes, you can use the fritzbox as modem https://deer-it.de/fritzbox-7412-modem-bridge-mode-pppoe-passthrough/).
	You can change the RED interface from the Webinterface to PPPOE. 
	----------------------------------------------------------

	A: Ports?
	
	Q: 222 - ssh , 441 - https

Part 3.0:

FIXING WIFI:

For some reason is the wifi broken... so we need to resolve that.

1. SSH on smoothwall / on port 222 (Port 222 is the standard port for ssh on Smoothwall) 17. Choose DNS Settings ![ ](https://teodorcucu.net/assets/img/rpi-firewall-bilder/Bild42.png)
2. Now we will use my script for fix WIFI ![ ](https://teodorcucu.net/assets/img/rpi-firewall-bilder/Bild43.png)

	
		bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teodorcucu/raspi4-smoothwall-wifi-fix/main/fix-wifi.sh)
	(Note that the Country Language is set to DE so you will need to change it after rebooting at /etc/hostapd/hostapd.purple.conf and reboot again.

3. Now we need activate DHCP for Purple WiFi, for that access the Webinterface and go to Services-dhcpd, scroll down to interface and choose Purple ![ ](https://teodorcucu.net/assets/img/rpi-firewall-bilder/Bild44.png) ![ ](https://teodorcucu.net/assets/img/rpi-firewall-bilder/Bild45.png)
4. Enable DHCP and set it up like in the picture ![ ](https://teodorcucu.net/assets/img/rpi-firewall-bilder/Bild46.png)

Thats it, now you can connect to the SSID 'Purple-Wifi' with the password 'password'. You can change it at /etc/hostapd/hostapd.purple.conf
